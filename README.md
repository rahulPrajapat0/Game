🎮 Gun, Snake & Water Game in Python 🐍🔫💧
I’ve created a simple yet fun Python game — a twist on the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors"!
In this version:

🔫 Gun beats 🐍 Snake

🐍 Snake drinks 💧 Water

💧 Water douses 🔫 Gun

💻 Built using core Python with:

Random module for computer moves

While loops and conditionals for gameplay logic

Score tracking and user interaction via terminal
